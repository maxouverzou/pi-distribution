    ## Context

    - Current git status: !{git status}
    - Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !{git diff HEAD}
    - Current branch: !{git branch --show-current}
    - Recent commits: !{git log --oneline -10}

    ## Your Task

    Create conventional git commit(s) intelligently based on the request and conversation context.

    ### Behavior Based on Arguments

    **No arguments (`/git-commit`):**
    - ONLY commit files that are directly related to our recent conversation work
    - Review recent conversation messages to identify which files we've been working on together
    - Exclude any unrelated changes that happen to be in the working tree
    - If unclear which files are "current work", ask the user for clarification

    **With description (`/git-commit [description]`):**
    - ONLY commit files that match the provided description
    - Use the description to filter which changed files should be included
    - Example: `/git-commit updates to slash commands` → only commit files in commands/ directory

    **Multi-commit request (`/git-commit do two commits for X and Y`):**
    - Parse the request to understand how many commits are needed
    - Create separate commits for each described change set
    - Example: `/git-commit do two commits, one for slash commands and one for skill-creator` → create 2 commits

    ### Critical Rules

    1. **Never commit everything blindly** - Always filter based on conversation context or description
    2. **Stage selectively** - Use `git add` to stage only the relevant files for each commit
    3. **Use conversation history** - Look at recent messages to understand what we've been working on
    4. **Ask when ambiguous** - If it's unclear what to commit, ask the user
    5. **Conventional format required** - All commits MUST follow conventional commit format

    ### Conventional Commit Format

    **Required format**: `type(scope): subject`

    **Common types:**
    - `feat`: New feature
    - `fix`: Bug fix
    - `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
    - `docs`: Documentation changes
    - `chore`: Maintenance tasks, tooling, configs
    - `test`: Test changes
    - `style`: Code formatting, whitespace
    - `perf`: Performance improvements

    **Scope guidelines:**
    - Use file/directory name or feature area
    - Examples: `skills`, `commands`, `hooks`, `agents`
    - Keep it short and meaningful

    **Subject guidelines:**
    - Use imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
    - Don't capitalize first letter
    - No period at the end
    - Be concise but descriptive
    - Never include metrics (e.g., "100x improvement", "removed 350 lines", "180% faster")
    - Avoid sales pitch language - focus on what changed, not how impressive it is

    **Examples:**
    - `feat(commands): add conversation-aware commit logic`
    - `refactor(skills): restructure skill-creator into subdirectory`
    - `fix(hooks): prevent duplicate execution on commit`
    - `chore(deps): update python dependencies`
  '';
